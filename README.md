# Mental-Fitness-Tracker

In today’s world, most of the people are suffering from different disorders which affect their mental fitness badly but they didn’t get able to know it. So here I am going to a discuss a tracking system that can track the level of mental fitness on the basis of some data of different disorders. I will discuss the data of mental disorder with the hep of visualization and make some machine learning models to predict the level of fitness. I will provide the overview of the problem as well as provide the solutions.

This is an artificial intelligence project in which we build a system to predict the level of mental fitness of a person by making a machine learning model by using different algorithms. It will help peoples to track their fitness by their own by providing some data of different disorders as input. The model has been trained on data of disorders of peoples belongs to different countries and of many years. Now days peoples only focus on their physical fitness and ignore others disorders which can lead to a bad mental fitness. So it is very necessary to keep an eye on mental fitness with the proper equipment and this AI system can help in a elegant way. 

As I found that many peoples are suffering from mental disorder but they are not able to keep an eye on it and their condition become more worse therefore I have developed a solution that will help everyone to track their mental fitness by their own just by providing some data of other disorders. It will provide the solution in terms of DALYs which is calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years lost due to disability (YLD) and provide expected life years in terms of percentage.
